3. Code Description: This exercise utilizes ReactJS, that makes a prototype for the Lazado E-commerce site. It features a flexbox-based layout with a reusable navigation panel, a header, four product category sections, and a dynamic shopping cart. Additionally, users can add items to the cart and delete them individually. The application also manages state using Reactâ€™s useState hook, and all components are organized in a components folder for modularity and reusability.
